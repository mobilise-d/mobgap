and thus how to rate the performance of a stride length calculation algorithm.

# Example Data
# ------------
# We load example data from the lab dataset.
# We will use a longer trial from an "MS" participant for this example.
# Additionally,
# we will load the reference stride length values to compare the results and evaluate the performance of the
# stride length calculation algorithm.
# To calculate the stride length, we will then use the initial contacts measured from the reference system.

# As this algorithm is designed to work on a single gait sequence at a time, we will iterate over the gait sequences
# present in the example data and calculate the stride length for each of them.

# Comparison with Reference
# --------------------------

# Next, the detected and reference stride lengths are concatenated into a single DataFrame.

# and the source of the data (``detected`` or ``reference``) in the second level.

# The concatenated DataFrame can then be used to evaluate the performance of the stride length calculation algorithm.
# For this purpose, first,
# the errors between the detected and reference stride lengths are calculated.
#
# Estimate Errors in stride length data
# ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# We can calculate a variety of error metrics to evaluate the performance of the stride length calculation algorithm,
# ranging from the simple difference between the estimated and ground truth values (simply referred to as ``error``)
# to its absolute value (``absolute_error``).
# Both can also be set in relation to the reference value (``relative_error`` and ``absolute_relative_error``).
# To apply these errors, we first need to build a list specifying the error functions to be applied.
# All the above-mentioned error functions are provided
# by the :class:`~mobgap.pipeline.evaluation.ErrorTransformFuncs` class.
# Note that you can also apply custom functions instead of the predefined ones.
# For more information on how to define custom error functions,
# see the :ref:`general example on DMO evaluation <gsd_evaluation_parameter>`.

    ("stride_length_m", [E.error, E.abs_error, E.rel_error, E.abs_rel_error])
]

# %%
# The error functions can be applied to the combined stride length data
# using the :func:`~mobgap.utils.df_operations.apply_transformations` function.
# The resulting DataFrame contains the error values for each gait sequence.
from mobgap.utils.df_operations import apply_transformations

# %%
# Before we now aggregate the results, we can also combine the error metrics with the reference and detected values
# to have all the information in one dataframe.
combined_sl_with_errors = pd.concat([combined_sl, sl_errors], axis=1)
combined_sl_with_errors

# %%
# Aggregate Errors
# ++++++++++++++++
# Finally, the estimated errors can be aggregated to provide a summary
# of the performance of the stride length calculation.
# For this purpose, different aggregation functions can be applied to the error metrics, ranging from simple, built-in
# aggregations like the mean or standard deviation to more complex functions like the limits of agreement or
# 5th and 95th percentiles.
# This can be done using the :func:`~mobgap.utils.df_operations.apply_aggregations` function.
# Possible aggregations are provided by the :class:`~mobgap.pipeline.evaluation.CustomErrorAggregations` class.
# There are two ways to define such aggregations:
#
# 1. As a list of tuples in the format ``(<identifier>, <aggregation>)`` with
#    ``<identifier>`` being the key for accessing the column to evaluate,
#    and ``<aggregation>`` being the aggregation function(s) to apply.
#    A valid list of aggregations could look like this:
from mobgap.pipeline.evaluation import CustomErrorAggregations as A

aggregations_simple = [
    *(
        (("stride_length_m", origin), [np.mean, A.quantiles])
        for origin in ["detected", "reference", "abs_error", "abs_rel_error"]
    ),
    *(
        (("stride_length_m", origin), [np.mean, A.loa])
        for origin in ["error", "rel_error"]
    ),
]
pprint(aggregations_simple)

# %%
# 2. As a named tuple of Type `CustomOperation` taking three values: `identifier`, `function`, and `column_name`.
#    `identifier` is a valid loc identifier selecting one or more columns from the dataframe, `function` is the
#    aggregation function or list of functions to apply,
#    and `column_name` is the identifier of the resulting column in the output dataframe.
#    This allows for more complex aggregations that require multiple columns as input, for example, the intra-class
#    correlation coefficient (ICC).
#    A valid aggregation list for calculating the ICC of all DMOs would look like this:
from mobgap.utils.df_operations import CustomOperation

aggregations_custom = [
    CustomOperation(
        identifier="stride_length_m",
        function=A.icc,
        column_name=("stride_length_m", "all"),
    )
]
pprint(aggregations_custom)

# %%
# For more detailed information on the aggregation types and their usage,
# check out the detailed example on it in the :ref:`general example on DMO evaluation <gsd_evaluation_parameter>`.
#
# Both types of aggregations can be combined and applied in a single call to the
# :func:`~mobgap.utils.df_operations.apply_aggregations` function.
# This returns a pandas Series with the aggregated values for each aggregation function and origin
# for the metric stride length.
# For better readability, we sort and format the resulting dataframe.

agg_results = (
    apply_aggregations(combined_sl_with_errors, aggregations)
    .rename_axis(index=["aggregation", "metric", "origin"])

    .sort_index(level=0)
    .to_frame("values")
