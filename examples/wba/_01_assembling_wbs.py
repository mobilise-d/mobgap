Assembling WBs
==============

An important part of the Mobilise-D pipeline is that we output WBs based on a fixed set of definitions.
These definitions are build based on a consensus process within the Mobilise-D consortium [1]_ and additional normative
data from the literature to define realistic ranges for stride and WB level parameters.

To support the process of creating WBs based on these and further custom rules, we provide a framework of dynamic rule
objects that can be adjusted and combined and then used to create WBs from a list of strides.
This works in 3 steps:

1. First, we filter the list of strides based on the stride-level rules.
2. Second, we iterate through the remaining list of strides and add them to a WB, until we reach a "Termination
   Criterion".
3. The WBs found in this way are then finally filtered based on WB-level rules.

# Step 1: Stride Selection
# ------------------------
# Stride selection is a relatively simple process.
# Each stride is defined by its start and end time and a set of parameters.
# Stride-level rules are basically just threshold rules for these parameters or the duration of the stride.
#
# Let's start by creating a list of strides with dummy values.
# We specifically create list of "left" and "right" strides and combine them at the end.
