Ullrich L/R Classifier
======================

The Ullrich L/R classifier is a general approach of differentiating left from right foot contacts using signal features
extracted from the gyroscopic data of a single IMU sensor placed on the lower back.
The feature vectors at the timepoints of the pre-detected initial contacts are then used in a typical binary
classification pipeline to predict the left/right label of each initial contact.

This example shows how to use the algorithm and how to train your own classification model on custom data.

#
# We load example data from the lab dataset together with the INDIP reference system.
# We will use the INDIP "InitialContact_Event" output as ground truth.
#
# We only use the data from the "simulated daily living" activity test from a single particomand.

# %%
# Applying the algorithm using reference ICs
# ------------------------------------------
# We use algorithm to detect the laterality of the initial contacts.
# For this we need the IMU data and the indices of the initial contacts per GS.
# To focus this example on the L/R detection, we use the reference ICs from the INDIP system as input.
# In a real application, we would use the output of the IC-detectors as input.
#
# First, we need to set up an instance of our algorithm.
# For ``LrcUllrich`` we provide a pre-trained model, which we can use to predict the L/R labels.
# They are all trained on the MS-Project (University of Sheffield) dataset, just on different sub cohorts and can
# be accessed using ``LrcUllrich.PredefinedParameters`.
# We will use the model trained on all participants of the MS-Project dataset.

# As we want to apply the algorithm to each gait sequence/WB individually, use the `GsIterator` to iterate over the
# reference wbs and apply the algorithm to each wb.
# Note, that we use the ``ic_list`` result key, as the output of all L/R detectors is identical to the output of the
# IC-detectors, but with an additional ``lr_label`` column.

# The output that we get provides us with an `lr_label` for each initial contact.
#
# Training a custom model
# -----------------------
# As ``LrcUllrich`` is machine-learning based, we provide the option to train a custom model on your own data.
# We even allow you to complete customize the classifier pipeline to test out different approaches.
#
# Here we will show how to train a custom model on the example data using the "low level" training interface.
# However, for most usecases (e.g. training with Hyperparatuning/evaulation with cross_validation/...) you will
# want to use the higher level Pipeline interface.
# A full example on how to use this is shown in the :ref:`evaluation example <lrc_evaluation>`.
#
# The low level interface involves directly calling the ``self_optimize`` method of ``LrcUllrich``.
# It takes a series of data sequences, their corresponding ICs and ground truth labels.
#
# But first, we need to define an untrained sklearn ML pipeline to provide to the algorithm for tuning.
