## [Unreleased]

### Added

- All dataset class have a new property called `data_ss` referring to the single sensor that should be used in the
  algorithms.
  This was added to move all data related config (i.e. which sensor to use in a pipeline) to the dataset class, making
  it easier to implement dataset agnostic pipelines (https://github.com/mobilise-d/mobgap/pull/119)
- A evaluation pipeline for GSD (https://github.com/mobilise-d/mobgap/pull/124)

### Changed

- The loaded reference data now has stricter dtypes (https://github.com/mobilise-d/mobgap/pull/119)

### Fixed

- Loading the reference data from a trial without identified WBs will not raise an error anymore, but will correctly
  return an empty DataFrame (https://github.com/mobilise-d/mobgap/pull/119)
- We use operating system independent pandas dtypes everywhere (https://github.com/mobilise-d/mobgap/pull/118)
