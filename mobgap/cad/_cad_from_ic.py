    This uses a robust outlier removal approach to deal with missing initial contacts.
    The output cadence is reported as the average for each 1 second bin within the data.
    An incomplete second at the end is removed.

    Regions (i.e. second bouts) with no initial contacts are interpolated linearly based on the surrounding values, if
    the gap is smaller than the specified maximum interpolation gap.
    Regions without initial contacts that are larger than the specified maximum interpolation gap or at the very start
    or end of the recording are filled with NaNs.

    For more details see the Notes section.
    """,
        "ic2cad_notes": """
    The full process of calculating the cadence per second from initial contacts is as follows:

    1. We calculate the step time from the initial contacts.
       This results in one less step time than initial contacts.
       We replicate the last step time to get the same number of step times as initial contacts, to also provide a
       cadence value for the last initial contact for the last part of a gait sequence.
    2. We smooth the step time to remove outliers (using a Hampel filter by default).
    3. We calculate the step time per second by averaging the step time over the second.
       This is a little tricky, as some seconds might not contain any initial contacts.
       For all seconds that contain at least one initial contact, we calculate the average step time over the second.
       The step time for seconds without initial contacts is interpolated linearly based on the surrounding values.
       If the gap is larger than the specified maximum interpolation gap, the second is filled with NaNs.
       We don't fill "gaps" at the start and end of the recording, as we assume that gait sequences are cut anyway
       to start and end with a valid initial contact.
    4. We smooth the step time per second again to remove outliers on a per second level.
    5. We calculate the cadence per second by taking the inverse of the step time per second.

    In case there are less initial contacts than the window size of the smoothing filter, we return NaNs for all
    seconds.

    This approach deviates from the original Matlab implementations in a couple of ways:

    1. The original Matlab implementation calculates the cadence first (before any smoothing) or interpolation, while
       we perform all calculations on the step time and only calculate the cadence at the very end.
       The reasoning behind that is that because cadence is calculated by taking an inverse, it is much harder to reason
       about outliers in the cadence values.
       Because of this "projection" it is also much harder to reason about what the effect of linear interpolation
       on the cadence values is.
    2. The original Matlab implementation has no concept of "maximum interpolation gap".
       Values are interpolated by taking the average of the surrounding values, independent of the length of the gap.
       We decided to introduce a maximum interpolation gap to not mask "issues" in the ic-detection.
    3. When values are interpolated, the original Matlab implementation uses the average of the surrounding values.
       We decided to use linear interpolation instead, as this is more robust to outliers.
       These approaches are identical, if we only need to interpolate a single value, but for larger gaps, linear
       interpolation will start favoring the "closer" neighboring values, which we think is more appropriate.
    4. The original Matlab implementation extrapolates missing values at the start and end of the recording, by simply
       repeating the first/last value.
       This was done, to make sure that subsequent calculations don't need to deal with NaNs, but can easily mask issues
       in the ic-detection.

    step_time_smoothing
        The filter used to smooth the step time.
        This is used to remove outliers in the step time/cadence (e.g. when initial contacts are not detected).
        The filter is applied twice, once to the raw step time and a second time on the interpolated step time values
        per second.
        We recommend to use a Hampel filter for this.
    max_interpolation_gap_s
        The maximum gap in seconds that is interpolated.
        If the gap is larger than this value, the second is filled with NaNs.
        We don't fill "gaps" at the start and end of the recording, as we assume that gait sequences are cut anyway
