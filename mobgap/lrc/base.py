class BaseLRClassifier(Algorithm):
    """Base class for L/R foot classifier.

    This base class should be used for all Left/Right foot classificaiton algorithms.
    Algorithms should implement the ``detect`` method, which will perform all relevant processing steps.
    The method should then return the instance of the class, with the ``ic_lr_list_`` attribute set to the ``ic_list``
    provided by the used with a new addition `lr` column that either contains the string ``left`` or ``right``,
    indicating the laterality of the initial contact.

    We allow that subclasses specify further parameters for the detect methods (hence, this baseclass supports
    ``**kwargs``).
    However, you should only use them, if you really need them and apply active checks, that they are passed correctly.
    In 99%% of the time, you should add a new parameter to the algorithm itself, instead of adding a new parameter to
    the detect method.
