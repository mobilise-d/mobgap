# TVS data preperation

This folder contains scripts to prepare the TVS dataset for release.

Prerequiesites:

- You have a local version of the TVS dataset in the original Mobilise-D internal format.
- You have the patient ID mapping file "TVS-participant-22032024.csv" mapping the internal IDs to the final data-warehouse ids.
- You the "participant_information.xlsx" file containing the participant information based on the internal IDs.

Then you can run the scripts in the following order (after adjusting the paths in the scripts):

1. `prepare_tvs_data.py` -> This will rename all ids and put everything into a new folder structure.
2. `manual_fix.m` -> Matlab script to manually fix some issues with the data (compare with compliance report generated by `prepare_tvs_data.py`).
3. `clean_turning_outputs.m` -> Matlab script to remove all turning related outputs from the data, as they should not be released.
