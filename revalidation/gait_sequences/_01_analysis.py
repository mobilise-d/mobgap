Performance of the gait sequences algorithm on the TVS dataset
==============================================================

The following provides an analysis and comparison of the GSD performance on the TVS dataset (lab and free-living).
We look into the actual performance of the algorithms compared to the reference data and compare these results with
the performance of the original matlab algorithm.

.. note:: If you are interested in how these results are calculated, head over to the
   :ref:`processing page <gsd_val_results>`.

We focus on the `single_results` (aka the performance per trail) and will aggregate it over multiple levels.

# Free-Living Comparison
# ----------------------
# We focus the comparison on the free-living data, as this is the most relevant considering our final use-case.
# In the free-living data, there is one 2.5 hour recording per participant.
# This means, each datapoint in the plots below and in the summary statistics represents one participant.
#
# For each participant, performance metrics were calculated by classifying each sample in the recording as either
# TP, FP, TN, or FN.
# Based on these values recall (sensitivity), precision (positive predictive value), F1 score, accuracy, specificity
# and many other metrics were calculated.
# On top of that the duration of overall detected gait per participant was calculated.
# From this we calculate the mean and confidence interval for both systems, the bias and limits of agreement (LoA)
# between the algorithm output and the reference data, the absolute error and the ICC.
#
# All results across all cohorts
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Note, that the `new_orig_peak` version is a variant of the new ``GsdIluz`` algorithm for which we tried to emulate the
# original peak detection algorithm as closely as possible.
# The regular `new` version uses a slightly modified peak detection algorithm.
