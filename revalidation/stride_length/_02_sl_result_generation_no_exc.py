.. _sl_val_gen:

Revalidation of the stride length algorithms
============================================

.. note:: This is the code to create the results! If you are interested in viewing the results, please check the
    :ref:`results report <sl_val_results>`.

This script reproduces the validation results on TVS dataset for the stride length.
It load results from the old matlab algorithms and runs the new algorithms on the same data.
Performance metrics are calculated on a per-trial/per-recording basis and aggregated (mean for most metrics)
over the whole dataset.
The raw per second stride length and all performance metrics are saved to disk.

.. warning:: Before you modify and re-run this script, read through our guide on :ref:`revalidation`.
   In case you are planning to update the official results (either after a code change, or because an algorithm was
   added), contact one of the core maintainers.
   They can assist with the process.

# Setting up "Dummy Algorithms" to load the old results
# -----------------------------------------------------
# Instead of just loading the results of the old matlab algorithms, we create dummy algorithms that respond with the
# precomputed results per trial.
# This way, we can be sure that the exact same structure is used for the evaluation of all algorithms.
#
# Note, that this is not the most efficient way to do this, as we need to open the file repeatedly and also reload the
# data from the matlab files, even though the dummy algorithm does not need it.

# ----------------------

# Note, that we use Memory caching to speed up the loading of the data.
# We also skip the recordings where the reference data is missing.
# In both cases, we compare against the INDIP reference system as done in the original validation as well.
#
# In the evaluation, each row of the dataset is treated as a separate recording.
# Results are calculated per recording.
# Aggregated results are calculated over the whole dataset, without considering the content of the individual
# recordings.
# Depending on how you want to interpret the results, you might not want to use the aggregated results, but rather
# perform custom aggregations over the provided "single_results".
